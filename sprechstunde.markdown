## Starting Monday, April 6th, I will offer* NTSprechstunde \o/

> Remember the good old days, when we huddled together in an enclosed space and pitched project ideas?  
> Do you need consultation or advice while working on your art?  
> I am offering Interactive, social distanced online mentorship!

I can begin with One-on-One sessions (via Skype/Facetime) immediately, 
but there will also be the possibility of establishing group activities. 

The format will depend entirely on your feedback and ideas – there are many tools out there but I first want to find out what we’ll be trying to achieve.
Everything will take place online in English, or by demand also in German and Hebrew.

I will be preparing a short registration form, but for now please express your interest by writing an email to [`sprechstunde@nts.is`](mailto:sprechstunde@nts.is)

Looking forward to see you soon,  
***NTS***

<small>*This offer is for free as long as we all #staythefuckathome</small>

<small>\o/ - yes, there will be a Frabo / questionnaire</small>
