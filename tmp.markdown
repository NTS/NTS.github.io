## Starting Monday, April 6th, I will offer* NTSprechstunde <br>\o/

> Remember the good old days, when we huddled together in an enclosed space and pitched project ideas?
> Do you need consultation or advice while working on your art?
> I am offering Interactive, social distanced online mentorship!

I'll begin with One-on-One sessions (via Skype/FaceTime/Jitsi/etc) immediately, 
but there will also be the possibility of establishing group activities. 

The format will depend entirely on your feedback and ideas – there are many tools out there but I first want to find out what we’ll be trying to achieve.
Everything will take place online in English, or by demand also in German and Hebrew.

I will be preparing a short registration form, but for now please express your interest by writing an email to [`sprechstunde@nts.is`](mailto:sprechstunde@nts.is)

Looking forward to see you soon,  
NTS
